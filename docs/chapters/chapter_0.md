# Vectors and their Properties

## What are Vectors?

In mathematics, and in its use, we often quantify amounts/states such as mass, time, force, economic conditions, circuit voltages, and points in space. However, only some of these quantities can be expressed using a single number (i.e. mass & time). To represent more complex _multi-component_ quantites we must use multiple numbers. We can do this using vectors.

Vectors can represent lots of different quantities; here are a couple.

```{tab} Points in 2D Space
$$
  \vec{v} = \bmatrix x \\ y \ematrix
$$
When $x$ and $y$ are real numbers (i.e. $x,y \in \R$), the vector $\vec{v}$ can represent any point in 2D space. This is possible because we can assign every point in 2D space a unique pair of *coordinates* $x$ and $y$.
